THIS IS NOT A FUNCTIONING PROJECT (graded at 88% despite this)

Project proposal: Webscraper that would pull in phrases, run it through Azure's Sentiment Analysis (Cognitive Service), output how the article viewed each subject on a positive to negative scale.

Massive limitations prevented the webscraper and Azure's machine learning working in tandem. Despite this, it was uploaded as it was a good deep-dive on the current state of Azure's machine learning, and I feel I learned a lot. It's also so you can view my code if you're curious on how the sentiment analysis works on a code level (or if you want to steal chunks).

If you can handle the mild rambling in the video (not uploaded yet), it will have a explanation what it does, how it works and what prevented the project from being successful.

The project won't work at all on download as the key for Azure's machine learning has long since been deleted. A video walkthrough (that was submitted to my prof) will be uploaded for a deep dive on the code when PII is scrubbed.
